# Grid Snapping and Alignment Feature Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for implementing grid snapping and component alignment functionality in the canvas editor. The feature will allow users to:

1. Snap components to a grid while dragging
2. Align components with each other during drag operations
3. Show visual feedback for snapping and alignment

## Requirements

Based on the feature request, the system must support:

- Grid snapping during component drag operations
- Component-to-component alignment (smart guides)
- Visual feedback for alignment and snapping
- Configurable grid settings (size, visibility)
- Performance optimization for real-time calculations

## Architecture

The feature will be implemented as an enhancement to the existing `ResizableWrapper` component with additional utilities for snapping calculations and visual guides.

### Key Components

1. **Snapping Engine** - Core logic for calculating snap positions
2. **Alignment System** - Component-to-component alignment detection
3. **Visual Guides** - Overlay elements showing alignment lines
4. **Grid System** - Background grid rendering and configuration
5. **Enhanced ResizableWrapper** - Modified drag behavior with snapping

## Detailed Design

### 1. Snapping Engine

The snapping engine will provide functions to calculate snap positions based on:
- Grid positions (configurable grid size)
- Other component boundaries (alignment snapping)
- Canvas boundaries

```typescript
interface SnapResult {
  x?: number;
  y?: number;
  snapType: 'grid' | 'component' | 'boundary' | 'none';
  guides?: AlignmentGuide[];
}

interface AlignmentGuide {
  type: 'vertical' | 'horizontal';
  position: number;
  sourceComponentId?: number;
}
```

### 2. Alignment System

The alignment system will detect when a dragging component is near alignment with other components:

- **Vertical Alignment**: Left, center, right edges
- **Horizontal Alignment**: Top, middle, bottom edges
- **Proximity Detection**: Configurable threshold (default: 5px)

### 3. Visual Guides

Visual guides will be rendered as overlay elements showing:
- Alignment lines when components align
- Grid indicators when snapping to grid
- Temporary guides during drag operations

### 4. Grid System

The grid system will include:
- Configurable grid size (default: 10px)
- Grid visibility toggle
- Grid rendering as background pattern

### 5. Enhanced ResizableWrapper

The `ResizableWrapper` component will be enhanced to:
- Integrate with the snapping engine during drag operations
- Show visual feedback for snapping
- Handle alignment detection and visual guides
- Maintain existing resize functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Snapping Engine

1. Create snapping utility functions
2. Implement grid-based snapping calculations
3. Add component boundary detection
4. Create alignment threshold logic

### Phase 2: Visual Feedback System

1. Implement alignment guide rendering
2. Add grid visualization
3. Create visual feedback for snapping
4. Optimize rendering performance

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Enhance ResizableWrapper with snapping logic
2. Integrate visual guide system
3. Add grid configuration options
4. Implement performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

1. Unit tests for snapping calculations
2. Integration tests with existing components
3. Performance testing
4. User experience refinement

## Data Models

### Grid Configuration

```typescript
interface GridConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  size: number; // in pixels
  visible: boolean;
  color: string;
  snapThreshold: number; // in pixels
}
```

### Component Bounds

```typescript
interface ComponentBounds {
  id: number;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  edges: {
    left: number;
    center: number;
    right: number;
    top: number;
    middle: number;
    bottom: number;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when snapping calculations fail
- Fallback to basic drag behavior if alignment system errors
- Performance monitoring to prevent UI blocking
- Error boundaries for visual guide rendering

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Snapping calculation accuracy
- Alignment detection precision
- Grid configuration handling
- Boundary condition handling

### Integration Tests

- Drag behavior with snapping enabled
- Visual guide rendering
- Performance under multiple components
- Grid configuration changes

### Performance Tests

- Real-time snapping calculations
- Visual guide rendering performance
- Memory usage with many components
- Responsiveness during drag operations

## Design Decisions

### 1. Client-Side Calculation

All snapping calculations will be performed client-side to ensure responsive UI and avoid network latency.

### 2. Overlay-Based Visual Guides

Visual guides will be implemented as overlay elements to avoid interfering with component rendering.

### 3. Configurable Thresholds

Alignment and snapping thresholds will be configurable to accommodate different user preferences and screen resolutions.

### 4. Performance Optimization

Calculations will be optimized using spatial indexing and throttling to maintain smooth drag operations.
